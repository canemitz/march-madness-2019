# March Madness 2019
## Using machine learning to predict game outcomes

### Description
Using game data since 2003, I trained a logistic regression model on the Four Factors (estimated field goal %, turnover rate, offensive rebound rate, and free throw rate) as well as the NCAA tournament seeding. I then made predictions for the tournament based on each team's average regular-season statistics.

For 2019, my model correctly predicted the winner of 47 of the 67 games that were played (70.1%).
